## About Sprint Retrospective Game

### What is a Sprint Retrospective?

The sprint retrospective meeting is held at the end of a sprint â€” a project management approach where teams complete specific tasks within a timeframe.

A sprint retrospective is a recurring meeting dedicated to discussing what went well in a sprint and what can be improved.

### Why do we do this?

This retro game is a project developed to make the sprint retrospective meeting more effective and fun.

### How it works?

2. Creates cards for team members to answer before the meeting.
3. Team members are invited to the room.
4. The participation of all team members, the game is started.
5. Each team member chooses a card in a colour of his/her choice.
6. After all team members choose their cards, the Scrum Master starts the game.
7. The game starts with the activation of the card chosen by a random team member.
8. This cycle ends with the opening of all cards.
